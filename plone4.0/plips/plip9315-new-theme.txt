PLIP 9315: New theme for Plone 4
================================

Note: Some viewlets should be disabled manually when testing: Breadcrumbs should
be hidden, Site Actions (accessibility, site map) should be in the footer (or
just disable when testing). This will be added to the default setup later.

The theme does not use tables for layout, but makes use of the new grid layout 
CSS from Plone 5 instead. This should work in all browsers, including IE6.

Overall, the goal is to have older browsers (IE6, IE7) functional, but we won't 
bend over backwards to get it pixel-perfect identical to browsers that support 
CSS2/3. Rounded corners are only shown in browsers that support it via CSS3, for 
instance.

We haven't done much cleanup of the markup, this is intentional since we want to
target this for Plone 5 instead. The goal has been that most Plone 3 themes that
have their own CSS should continue to work in Plone 4. Let me know if you see
otherwise.

The idea is to ship with the old default theme installed, so that upgraded sites
that are using it will keep their styling. It should be separated out into a
separate product, though. It is a goal to have at least two entries in the
Themes control panel, so people see that Plone can look very different
immediately after a first install.
