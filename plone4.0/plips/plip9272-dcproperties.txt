PLIP 9272: Exposing Dublin Core properties
===================================================
This PLIP is ready for review.
PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9272


Further ideas
-------------
- Proper load testing, ie Funkload
- Showing a list of the exposed properties could be usefull, but that is more an addon product (collective.dublincore or something like that).
- Implement a way to overrule the exposed properties (ie. disable dc.creator, edit keywords ), see also http://plone.org/products/plone-seo


Summary of changes
------------------
- Added field to Plone site controlpanel (https://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/28477)
- Re-added metatags loop in main_template (removed in https://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/27845#file11)
- Check allowAnonymousViewAbout and support fullnames in DC properties (https://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/28617)


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------
- Documentation for the Plone control panel (site setup)
