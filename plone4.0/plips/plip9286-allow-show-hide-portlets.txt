PLIP 9286: Allow to show/hide portlets
=================================================================

This plip is ready for final review.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9286

Answers to review questions are at the bottom.

To do
-----

- After merge, links for show/hide options should use specific symbols. 
  Currently, they are only text links. Although, show/hide options are quite
  clear and it should bew reviewed by the UI team.

- Use different style for hidden portlets. This needs to take into account
  plip #9285, which also adds new style to identify blocked portlets.

- Migration path to handle hidden property in old instances of 
  plone.portlet.static.

Summary of changes
------------------

- Added new options show/hide to portlet management screen. Hidden portlets
  are shown in the management screen, but not when viewing.
  The implementation strategy is based on a new feature to add in
  plone.portlets (portlet assignment settings) that basically consists of a
  list of settings (per assignment) that can be also used by other
  implementations. By default, there is only the 'visible' setting.

- Removed field 'hide' from plone.portlet.static's schema, and added 
  deprecation message for the use of the 'hide' parameter at
  static.Assignment's contructor.

- Added new assignment attribute ("visible") to import/export the visible
  property. For example an assingment in portlet.xml can be as follows:

    <assignment
        manager="plone.leftcolumn"
        category="context"
        key="/"
        type="portlets.Calendar"
        name="calendar"
        visible="0"
        />

  If "visible" is "0", the portlet will be hidden. If "visible" is "1" or
  in its absence, the portlet will be shown.

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- The Plone User Manual needs to be updated, more specifically the "Portlet
  Management" section:
  http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual/portlet-management/


Backwards compatibiliy
-----------------------

Migration for legacy static portlets not implemented yet.
