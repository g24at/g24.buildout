PLIP 9250: JQuery Tools Integration
===================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9250

Second Review by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6 using python 2.6.1 and Firefox 3.5.3.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9250-jqtools-integration.cfg file.

- Visual review of the code in plone.app.jquerytools.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- The package is renamed to plone.app.jquerytools as suggested.

- The javascript resource is named "plone.app.jquerytools.js". Like mentioned in
  my first review I think it's better to use: "<packagename>.<fullname>" to
  avoid inconsistant names when packages have multiple javascript files. I
  suggest naming the javascript file "plone.app.jquerytools.jquery.tools.js".

- This issue from my first review is still open:
  There are no javascript tests available for jQuery Tools as far as I can tell
  so I couldn't run those. I also couldn't find out if a public version control
  system is used to maintain the code. Can you clarify if both assumptions are
  correct?

- Any comment on the following from my first review?
  Looking at the current javascript functionality used in Plone the only thing
  which can be replaced using jQuery Tools are the tabs. It would be nice if we
  used at least one of the features of jQuery Tools to show add-on developpers
  we use it for Plone itself. Can the current tabs be replaced with the jQuery
  Tools tabs?


Conclusion
----------

Some minor issues which are mentioned above. +1 for merging.
