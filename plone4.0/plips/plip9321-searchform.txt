===============================================================

This plip is ready for review/merging

Changes
-------

 1. removed categories from advances search if no categories are
    defined in the site.

 2. remove workflow states for anonymous visitors (configurable)

 3. only list content types and workflow states for which at least one
    object exists

 4. add display options for sort order and batch size (configurable).
    This required to set different sort orders. Without setting a
    specific sort order, the catalog sorts ascendenting. When sorting
    by date, we want an descendenting sort order.  The search form
    uses the queryCatalog script, that is a hack to compose query form
    the request (also by interpreting request parameters with a
    special format). To get the sort_order into the query, I set the
    request.form['sort_order'] value to descendenting where
    required. Manipulating the request from a page template is not a
    good practice and adding a kwarg to queryCatalog would be cleaner,
    but I choose it to keep it backward compatibile.

 5. remove title and description input boxes, just leave Searchable Text. 
    (configurable)

 6. Collapse less often used search options by default if javascript
    is enabled (configurabel) Collapsed are "New Item since", "Item
    Type", "Author" and "Review State" (and "Title" and "Description"
    if they are enabled"). This leaves "Search Text", "Categories",
    "Sort on" and batch size. (configurable)

 7. If an advanced search happened, the variables are encoded into the link 
    to the advanced search. The advanced search form is rendered (hidden) 
    when the search results are displayed. A link "Edit your search options"
    works like a normal link if javascript is not enabled. If javascript is 
    enabled it makes the hidden advanced search form visible without 
    a page reload. (done)
   
 * Control panel work for the points above: All Properties are stored
   in portal_properties/site_properties. There was the option to use
   plone.registry that is used by some other PLIPs now. I choose to
   save it in portal_properties 'cause the two other configuration
   values both are stored there.

    1. status:dropped. (An option is not needed here, I can't think of
       a situation where it brings a usability improvement to show
       it. Fewer Options in the control panel are more valuable.)
    2. status:done
    3. status:dropped. (See 1.)
    4. status:done
    5. status:done
    6. status:done

 * added a helper view to plone.app.controlpanel.search.SearchFormOptions. 
   It's not really part of the control panel and should be located somwhere else.
   But it's only a helper to get the option defined in the control panel schema.
   Maybe I move it to plone.app.search if this package get's into Plone 4.
 

To do
-----
 * write tests for the extended control panel adapter

Changes to documentation
------------------------

No changes to the documentation are necessary.

Further ideas
-------------

 * implement the configuration matrix (enable for logged in|not logged in users) 
   for all fields in the search form.
 * replace categories widget with a more usable javascript driven
