PLIP 9263: GenericSetup syntax for importing Sharing page roles
===============================================================

Review by Erik Rose (ErikRose@psu.edu, ErikRose on IRC)

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using Python 2.6.2.

Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout and bin/develop up.

- Wrote a product using the new functionality. Installed it and uninstalled it.

- Examined code.

- Didn't test migration path from collective.sharingroles.
 
Notes and observations
---------------------- 

- Functionality works great. Installs and uninstalls work as expected.

- Can we not have to specify which attributes are internationalizable in every
  <role> tag (e.g., i18n:attributes="title")? Shouldn't the tag handling
  machinery know that what's translatable implicitly? Documentation is pretty
  hard to come by on this.

- A bit off topic, I second pupq's comment about newbies being confused by the
  "Can edit" labels. This feature probably had the opposite intention. What does
  the FWT think of removing those from the UI in favor of the actual role name?
  Good idea, bad idea? 4.0, 4.1?

Conclusion
----------

+1 for merging, as this is a pain in Plone 3. I'd like to see the
i18n:attributes made implicit, though. (Is it already optional? Can title be
translated even if it's omitted? i18n:attributes does have a secondary
use--specifying custom msg IDs--so it's conceivable. I don't have an
internationalized product handy to test with at the moment, however.)

Update, 10/6/2009
-----------------

Martin and Hanno explained that the i18n attributes are completely ignored by
GS. They're optional and used only by i18ndude to find messages to extract.
Thus, they have no bearing on this PLIP, and I am unreservedly +1 for merging.
