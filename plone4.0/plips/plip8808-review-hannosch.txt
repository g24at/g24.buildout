PLIP 8808: Require Python 2.6, Zope 2.12, and CMF 2.2 for Plone 4.0
===================================================================

External review by Hanno Schlichting <hannosch>.

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6 using Python 2.6.2 (64-bit).

Review steps
------------

- Reviewed a complete diff of all changed packages comparing the respective
  3.3 branch and the 4.0 branch. Made some small adjustments.

Missing review steps
--------------------

- Do a diff review of all changed packages comparing the code used in 4.0 vs.
  the 5.0 code.

- Make sure we use newer branches / versions of all packages where needed.

Todos
-----

- Verify all package dependencies are declared in 4.0 packages. Make sure
  ZTK packages are used instead of old zope.app packages.

- Use zope.publisher.browser.BrowserView instead of
  Products.Five.browser.BrowserView. This avoids all the aq_inner calls and
  removes a whole bunch of hard to debug error conditions.

- Review the actions related optimizations and make sure we have reasonable
  BBB support while still getting a speed-up.

Conclusions
-----------

+1 on keeping it merged ;)
