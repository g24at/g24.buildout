Summary
--------

The portions of this PLIP affecting existing Plone packages appear to
be well executed.  Backwards compatibility imports are provided for
all classes and methods from Products.ATReferenceBrowserWidget.  Core
packages that refer to Products.ATReferenceBrowserWidget have been
updated to refer to the new import locations.  No migration is in
place to add the new skin folder location and remove the reference to
the old one.  This is a critical feature for the acceptance of this
PLIP, but should be easy to implement.

The archetypes.referencebrowserwidget package looks well designed in
the areas where it departs from the original package.  It appears to
support all the features of the original package and has a reasonable
array of unit, integration, and functional tests.  It seems to be
provide a significant improvement over the package which it replaces
in terms of maintainability (and maintainership).

Through the web testing confirms that it provides the expected
functionality, with a few cosmetic improvements, like reference order
support.  The demo type provides a reasonable demonstration of the
supported features.


Issues & Concerns
---------------------

The lack of a migration to replace the existing skin layer with the
new one is a critical but easily reparable flaw.  Other than that this
PLIP appears to be ready for inclusion in Plone 4.0.
