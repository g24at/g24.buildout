Review comments on PLIP 8802 (use GS upgrade steps) by Raphael Ritz
===================================================================

Sept 16, 2009

checked out 
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.0
at r29734

Read through the code of the migration tool and some of 
plone.app.upgrade


Observations
------------

- No need to activate anything as this already part of the 4.0 branch
  already

- Why has CMFPlone/migrations been removed completely?
  Wouldn't emptying it and leaving a note in there be better
  in terms of documenting how things have changed?

- iterate and openid are lacking profile versions

- The decision to only support upgrades from 2.5 and not 2.1
  as initially intended is fine with me. People upgrading from
  2.1 can indeed be required to perform a two-step upgrade

- Could not reproduce the error on the ATCT tool Hanno has reported

- Other than that I can confirm Hanno's observations to the
  extend that I have tested already

TODO
----

Upgrade real sites of mine and see what happens.
Carefully compare the results with new Plone 4 sites.


i18n
----

As this PLIP does not affect anything that users of Plone 
sites will get to see (except for admins in ZMI which so
far never provided i18n support) I see no impact here.


Documentation
-------------

As I'm not aware of any docs on using GS upgrade steps for Plone
(proper or add-ons) this is probably the most important single
piece missing around this PLIP now.


Summary (preliminary)
-------

Looks good already (no wonder as done by Hanno and David) and
while this PLIP might trigger the surfacing of some bugs it
will often times not be due to this PLIPs scope but other
shortcomings.
