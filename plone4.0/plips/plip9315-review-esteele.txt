PLIP 9329: Manage actions through Plone
=======================================

Review #1 by Eric Steele, on behalf of the FWT (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on irc)

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

Review steps
------------

 - Ran buildout using the plip9315-new-theme.cfg file.

 - Visual inspection of the code
 
 - Start Zope, create new Plone site, install plonetheme.sunburst
 
Notes and observations
---------------------- 

* Breaks tests in Products.CMFPlone, plone.app.upgrade.

* Nice, clean design.

* No breadcrumbs.

* Less !importants (13). !Yay

* CSS is much easier to read.

* I'm seeing the dropdown menus hide behind elements like the footer.

* Line running through fieldset tabs in /edit views.

* Lack of contrast between background of fields with validation errors and the error message (red on salmon).

* Quite a bit of text throughout the site tiny to the point of being nearly unreadable (navtree, search results).

Conclusions 
-----------
Fix breaking tests. 

There's a lot of work to do before considering this finished and I'm not going
to spend time picking at minor design details in this review.

I like the design. I like the general idea behind the changes made. Consider
me +1 on inclusion, assuming it's finished at some point.


Merge Review
------------

About 52K lighter (unmerged) than the current plone theme.

Plays nicely with the existing ("classic") theme. The two flip back and forth
without issue in the Themes prefs panel.

Backed off on HTML5, which, for no good reason, makes me a bit more comfortable.

Still lots of little details to be worked out, but in all: it's a theme, and
one by Limi at that, it was destined to be a work in progress. It's a good
design, well implemented. Recommend +1 for merge.
