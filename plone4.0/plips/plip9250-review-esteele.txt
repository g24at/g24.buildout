PLIP 9250: JQuery Tools Integration
===================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9250

Review #1 by Eric Steele (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on irc)

Review steps
------------

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

 - Ran tests for plone.app.jqtools
 
 - Ran tests for CMFPlone

 - Visual inspection of the code
 
 - Start Zope, create new Plone site. 
 
Notes
-----
 
 - Tests for plone.app.jqtools pass (Ran 5 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.464 seconds)

 - Tests for Plone pass (ie. no change in what tests already break in Plone)

 - No questionable dependencies (Products.CMFCore, Products.GenericSetup)

 - Code looks clean, both in plone.app.jqtools and changes to Products.CMFPlone.
 
 - Script installed automatically, and is listed right after jquery-integration, where it should be. 
 
 - Confirmed the script was being loaded within the site using Firebug.

 - No tests for actual functionality. I'll defer to Rob and the fact that I've used the standard jQuery tools package elsewhere.
 
 - I'm in agreement with Rob that the package name should be changed to "plone.app.jquerytools".
 
 - +0 on changing the name of the script registration in portal_javascripts
 
 - Would like to see this package used somewhere in the Plone 4.0 release.
 
Conclusion
----------
 
  A nice straightforward package. With a name change, I'd recommend inclusion.
  
Merge Review Update
-------------------
Updates made are straightforward and address the review concerns. Recommend +1
for inclusion.

We'll work on including jQuery Tools functiÂ¬onality once merging has been completed.
