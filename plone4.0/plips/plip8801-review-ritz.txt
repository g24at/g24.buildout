Review comments on PLIP 8801 (no action icons any more) by Raphael Ritz
=======================================================================

Sept 16, 2009

checked out 
https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.0
at r29734


Observations
------------

- No need to activate anything as this already part of the 4.0 branch

- Building went fine

- Witnessed deprecation warnings

- Plone instantiation OK

- Former use of action icon declarations have been moved 
  to the actions themselves except for kupu and versioning


Issues
------

- kupu, versioning, workflow policy (CMFPlacefulWorkflow), and staging 
  (iterate) still use the action icon tool

- The ZMI view of the action icon tool could show the deprecation
  warning as well


i18n
----

no impact as far as I can see


Documentation
-------------

As mentioned by the PLIP authors there are very few mentionings of 
action icons out there that need updating.


Summary
-------

Well, done! 
Bonus points for updating kupu, versioning, iterate, and placeful 
workflow.



Unrelated observations
----------------------
(These observations don't affect this PLIP but I list them here so 
I won't forgetthem)

- there is still no icon for the 'rename' action

- isDefaultPage as called from the navigation portlet provocs:

   [..]
   Module plone.app.portlets.portlets.navigation, line 150, in root_item_class 
   TypeError: isDefaultPage() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)

  after adding a news item to the news section

- playing with the news item a bit and comparing revisions gives:

    Request URL     http://localhost:8080/plip8801/news/hello-world/version_diff
    Exception Type  KeyError
    Exception Value 'current_page_url'

  when called from viewing a former revision (but not when called from the 
  initial history view)
