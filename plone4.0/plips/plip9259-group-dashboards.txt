PLIP 9259: Group dashboards
===========================

This plip is ready for merging.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9259

Post-merge activities
---------------------

- add rolemap.xml entries for the following permissions

    - "Portlets: Manage group portlets" => Manager
    - "Portlets: View dashboard"        => Member

- this needs to be added to the content views list in prefs_group_details and
  prefs_group_members:
  
      <li>
        <a href=""
           tal:attributes="href string:${portal_url}/@@manage-group-dashboard?key=${request/key}"
           i18n:translate="label_group_dashboard">Group Dashboard</a>
      </li>

Summary of changes
------------------

- One new permission added:

    - "Portlets: View dashboard", used to control access to the dashboard.
      Note that this previously used "Portlets: Manage own portlets", which
      meant it was impossible to let someone see a group dashboard, but not
      edit their own portlets. This also necessitated a change in the
      PersonalBarViewlet
    
    - NOTE: This permission is not set up by default yet, because I didn't
      want to branch the Plone egg in order to modify rolemap.xml. To test the
      dashboard as non-Manager, edit the permission in the portal root.
    
- plone.app.layout's dashboard and viewlets modules changed to use these 
  permissions.

- A new ++groupdashboard++ namespace added to plone.app.portlets.

- A new GroupDashboardPortletAssignmentMapping added to plone.app.portlets.

- A new @@manage-group-dashboard view added, with a link from the
  @@manage-group-portlets view.

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

We should document this feature, and the permission changes. Something like:

It is now possible to assign dashboard portlets by group as well as by user.
Go to Site Setup, Users and Groups, find a group and click on Group Dashboard.
Here, you can assign portlets to this group's dashboard. Members of the
group will see these portlets on their dashboard, underneath any personal
dashboard portlets.

In addition, the permissions controlling access to the dashboard have been
made more granular:

 * "Portlets: View dashboard" is used to control who can see the dashboard.
 * "Portlets: Manage own portlets" is used to control access to the "edit"
   tab of the dashboard, and thus the ability to manage personal dashboard
   portlets.

Future ideas
------------

It should be possible to delegate the ability to edit the dashboard for
particular groups. This would require some UI to allow the administrator set
set up a "dashboard administrator" for each group, and the appropriate
security checks.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

People who have taken away "Portlets: Mange own portlets" to hide the
dashboard will now need to take away "Portlets: View dashboard" as well.
