PLIP 9321: Reimplement the search form with an eye on usability
===============================================================

- Category-hiding is great. Bravo. Also love the hiding of unused workflow
  states. This is a significant improvement in clarity with no downside.

- At the moment, a novice user still has to confront the labels of every
  widget. Have you user-tested this new form? Was there an improvement? If the
  aim is to improve clarity through information hiding, it might be better to
  hide all the infrequently used widgets under a single More... (or something)
  section and disclose them all at once.

  > labels visible (not collapsed "inside" the subheading)
  > This way the user can distinct the collapsed labels from the rest while
  > he still can see without a further action what options he can have.
  > This also allows to uncollaps only a single option if the user had 
  > submitted the form and choose a value for that option. Cause the option
  > is uncollapsed the user sees that he had choosen an option that is not
  > the default.  
  > I also added a second heading "display options" so the page has overall 
  > more structure.

- In WebKit-based browsers (like Safari 4.0 (5530.17)), when the window is
  narrow enough for the widget descriptions to wrap, the page jumps all over the
  place during the jQuery reveal effect dur to spurious text rewrapping. It's
  distracting.

  > I fixed it by switching to a slide effect which is only a vertical animation
  > and does not lead to problems in Safari (tested with 4.0.3/windows).

- Let's replace "Titles (alphabetically)" in the Sort Results menu with simple
  "Title". What else would Title sort by?

  > Done

- Item Type is never collapsed, though the PLIP says (and I tend to agree) it
  should be.

  > Changed, moved into the "More options" section.

- Why 30, 60, or 90 results per page? It's nitpicky, but I thought they were
  unusual numbers. :-) If any of the search results display PLIPs implement AJAX
  batching (assuming that (1) it's much more responsive than loading the whole
  page and perhaps that (2) it doesn't hide the previous results but instead
  appends to them), we should be able to remove this control altogether.

  > I did not look at the finished implementation of the search results page
  > yet, so if they implemented it I'll remove the duplicated parts.
  > The current hard coded value is 30 so I choose multibles of it. One option 
  > would be to make it configurable. In any way it should be the same in 
  > all standard batches. I did not look into it but guess 25 is more common.

    Configlet
    ---------

    - As stated the "To do" section above, English in widget descriptions
      needs polish: "not logged in users" -> "anonymous users", don't capitalize
      "Visitors", etc. "How to search" should read "how to sort".

      > Done. There is unfortuantely no common vocabulary in the control panes.

    - Group options (in a fieldset?) rather than repeating "Show option to
      this", "Show option to that", "Show option to the other thing".

      > I moved the options to an own fieldset, shortened te labels and added
      > description texts.

    - Rethink required-ness of checkbox widgets. What does it even mean for a
      checkbox widget to be required?

Update, 10/7/2009
-----------------

- Addition of headings make page much more scannable. Nice work!

- JS transitions look good now.

- All other concerns addressed.

+1 for merge. Very nice work. I'd like to tweak some of the configlet UI and language after the merge, though.
