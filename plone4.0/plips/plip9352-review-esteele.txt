PLIP 9352: combination of search results plips
===================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9352

Review #2 by Eric Steele (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on irc)

Review steps
------------

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

 - Visual inspection of the code
 
 - Start Zope, create new Plone site. 
 
Notes
-----

 * Lacking tests for most of the functionality. Coverage for plone.app.form: 62% for browser.py, 16% for queryparser.py
 
 * Path in search results is a nice touch, but I found myself initially
   confused by the fact that it was rendering as a visited link while the main
   link to the item wasn't. Does this need to be a link at all?

 * Display relevance since we're showing it as sorting option? My initial
   thoughts expect it to be there, but further thought says it's pointless.
 
 * Batching doesn't work past page 1.
 
 * I'd rather it not show all content in the initial results when viewing @@search. 
 
 * A mostly-unrelated mini-rant. I've always wished we'd increase the size of
   the batch navigation links. They've got way too small of a clickable area.

 
Conclusion
----------
+0 Overall it feels cleaner, but there are still a lot of todos for this in the implementation notes.
Defering my vote until I see a completed product.
