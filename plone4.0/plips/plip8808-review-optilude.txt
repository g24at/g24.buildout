Conclusions
-----------

I don't think it's possible to vote this PLIP down. It is (one of) the
raison d'etre for Plone 4. Being able to use Python 2.6 puts us on a more
modern footing, reduces the risk of Plone being unable to adopt third party
packages that depend on newer Python features, and should give a speed boost
to boot. Being able to use Zope 2.12 means that we'll ship with more up-to-
date versions of many Zope 3/Zope Toolkit. These days, people have to manually
update packages in a messy way to be able to use things like z3c.form or get
access to a less buggy release of zope.schema.

There will doubtless be some pain associated with these updates, but the cost
of staying on Zope 2.10, Zope 3.3 packages and Python 2.4 will only continue
to grow if we do not adopt this.

It is important that we document the changes carefully, and note any
incompatibilities or required changes in third party products. We'll also need
to pull together and fix the bugs that will inevitably be found. The state of
the 4.0 branch is quite encouraging at the moment, though. For one thing, it
starts up and there are no tests failures.
