PLIP 9329: Manage actions through-the-plone
===========================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9329

This is an extra UI-review by Geir Bækholt (geir@elvix.com ,baekholt on irc).
Not on the framework team but asked by Eric Steele to review this plip. 

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using python 2.6.1 and Safari 4.0.3


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9329-manage-actions-ttp.cfg file.

- Ran tests for plone.app.controlpanel

- Started instance, created site, browsed to @@actions-controlpanel 
  evaluated the UI and interaction. 


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Ran 123 tests for plone.app.controlpanel with 0 failures and 0 errors 

- It was puzzling and unexpected to arrive to an empty panel with just a 
  select option. I'd prefer to have the first option selected. With as few 
  actions as we have in Plone, i'd rather recommend just having a long list 
  with section headers and all actions immediately displayed rather than the
  select option. More advanced is not neccesarily better.   

- The edit action view displayes a breadcrumb with unusable items.
  Clicking a link in the breadcrumb will not take you back, but lose all
  context and leave you navigated to the portal actions tool or something
  similar.

- When saving an action, i am dropped to the controlpanel with a message 
  saying the action was edited, but the category has been reser to the default
  so i cannot see my newly edited action anymore. 

- There is space in the UI for the descriptions of the actions, but the 
  description is not rendered.

- The link for each action points to the result of the action itself. 
  This is confusing. When editing actions, i'd expect that clicking it would
  take me to the edit form. A link named 'preview' would be better for the 
  actual result link. 
  
- The icons are not used in the listing. For the more visual sites, it would
  be handy to also show the icon.

- The form elements that take CMF Expressions need help labels telling about 
  syntax, where to find more information and that this is an advanced user 
  interface.
  
- The Form elements that take CMF Expressions are too short. There is not 
  enough room for the sort of expressions people normally write.

- There is no UI for reordering. 

- Using a link to delete is wrong use of UI concepts. The common UI logic on
  the web is that links take you to new pages and buttons perform actions. 
  Using a link to delete breaks fundamental UI concepts. 

- Deleting doesn't ask for confirmation. — Something users have come to 
  expect. It is too easy to accidentally delete an action. To non-developers
  this can potentially cause havoc in their sites. I recommend not even having
  a delete action. The enable/disable button is enough. It would, however be
  helpful with a visual indication in the main list of actions whether they 
  are enabled or not. (greyed out, striketrhough?). Ohhh. I just realised that
  this is shown in the list. Then i change my comment to "it must be more
  clearly visually indicated"… :) 

- if i add garbage to an expression field, it is no longer possible to open
  the corresponding section of the actions list. This part needs error
  handling


Conclusion
----------
With the current UI i find myself clicking the "wrong" thing all the time,
something that is very annoying. 

Needs some UI cleanup but seems generally ok. Can end up as a useful feature 
for the technical site-admins that don't dare to venture to the ZMI but 
wants some more advanced control. 

-1 in its current state. 
+1 if the UI is cleaned up.
