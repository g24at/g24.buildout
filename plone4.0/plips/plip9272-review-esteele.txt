PLIP 9329: Manage actions through Plone
=======================================

Review #1 by Eric Steele, on behalf of the FWT (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on
irc)

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

Review steps
------------

 - Ran buildout using the plip9272-dcproperties.cfg file.
 
 - Visual inspection of the code
 
 - Start Zope, create new Plone site, 
 
 - Ran funkload tests using a modified version of collective.coreloadtests
   that set a True value for exposeDCMetaTags.
 
Notes and observations
---------------------- 

New tags added to front-page:

    <meta content="Congratulations! You have successfully installed Plone." name="DC.description" />
    <meta content="Congratulations! You have successfully installed Plone." name="description" />
    <meta content="text/html" name="DC.format" />
    <meta content="Page" name="DC.type" />
    <meta content="admin" name="DC.creator" />
    <meta content="2009-09-04 14:52:40" name="DC.date.modified" />
    <meta content="2007-08-18 20:28:30" name="DC.date.created" />
    <meta content="en-us" name="DC.language" />

And on a new event
    <meta content="event description" name="DC.description" />
    <meta content="event description" name="description" />
    <meta content="text/html" name="DC.format" />
    <meta content="Event" name="DC.type" />
    <meta content="admin" name="DC.creator" />
    <meta content="2009-09-04 15:36:38" name="DC.date.modified" />
    <meta content="2009-09-04 15:36:38" name="DC.date.created" />

I notice that there is no DC.language tag, presumably because I left that
field at the default (site default). We should probably be providing that
info

I don't see the on/off toggle in /edit view that is mentioned in the proposal.

No added tests.

Minimal code changes. Nothing particularly notable.

Funkload tests show no appreciable difference in rendering times. I've
attached the read-only result to the ticket. See me for the remainder if
you're curious.

Conclusions 
-----------
I'd be +1 for inclusion once
1) DC.Language defaults to sitewide value when not specifically defined
2) There are tests.

Merge Review
------------
Implementer has added more tests and sufficiently justified my question on dc.language.
Recommend +1 for merging.
