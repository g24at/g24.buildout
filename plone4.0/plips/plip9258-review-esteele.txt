PLIP 9258: Replace Products.ATReferenceBrowserWidget with
archetypes.referencebrowserwidget
=================================

Review #2 by Eric Steele, on behalf of the FWT (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on
irc)

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

Review steps
------------

 - Ran buildout using the plip9258-referencebrowser.cfg file.

 - Ran tests for archetypes.referencebrowserwidget

 - Ran test coverage for archetypes.referencebrowserwidget

 - Visual inspection of the code

 - Start Zope, create new Plone site, edit front-page, and add some related items.

Notes and observations
----------------------

* Documentation appears to be thorough.

* No non-standard dependencies (though I question the use of adding things like zope.interface and zope.component to setup.py).

* UI works much like the package it's replacing. Adds reodering. Works nicely.

* I wonder if we might do this with an overlay instead of a popup, assuming the jQuery tools PLIP passes.  

* 60% test coverage overall for the package.
 
Conclusions
-----------
+1 for inclusion. Consider implementing some of the frilly UI stuff from jQuery tools.

Merge Review Update:
--------------------

Looks great. We'll hold off on any jQuery tools work until after merge and UI team discussion. 
I recommend +1 for inclusion. Thanks!
