Review Process
--------------

- bin/buildout -vN -c plips/plip9305-fullname.cfg
- Ran tests, generated a diff against failures from plipbase.cfg
- review the branch diff

- did a search for "welcome", got the front-page, no by-line
- turned on "Allow anyone to view 'about' information" in the site
  control panel/configlet
- did a search for "welcome", got the front-page, by-line with "admin"
- set admin fullname in profile
- did a search for "welcome", got the front-page, by-line with new
  full name
- clicked RSS link, fullname in dc:creator

- add profile-collective.contentgenerator:public to plipbase.cfg,
  re-run coreloadtests for baseline.  Ran into a problem with
  collective.contentgenerator, had to disable groups.
- add profile-collective.contentgenerator:public to
  plip9305-fullname.cfg, re-run coreloadtests for baseline

Needs Work
----------

- test failures

Some tests fail when this PLIP is deployed that didn't fail with
plipbase.cfg.  See plips/plip9305-review-rossp-tests.diff for the
differences.

Notes
-----

Looking at the diff for the branch, I'm not seeing where the fullname
is added to the author info, I only see the changes to the templates.
Is that all this PLIP involves now is template changes?

No performance problems apparent so far.  The current round of
benchmarks seem suspect, so I'll adjust this when I re-confirm things
if problems show up.
