PLIP 9376: Merge archetypes.schematuning into Archetypes
=================================================================

This plip is ready for review.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9376


Branches made
-------------

https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/Products.Archetypes/branches/plip9376-schematuning


Summary of changes
------------------

- Merge archetypes.schematuning into AT 1.6 and update affected tests.


To do
-----

- Confirm that per-instance schemas still work as intended. 

Tests
-----

  bin/test -s Products.Archetypes

As of 19 Aug 2009 a few tests from the AT 1.6 branch are still failing. 
This PLIP is not responsible for those failures.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

Archetypes reference manual should inform developers that they must call 
invalidateSchema whenever a schema is changed at runtime. (Luckily most 
developers do not alter the schema at runtime.)
