PLIP 9263: GenericSetup syntax for importing Sharing page roles
===============================================================

This is a basic review covering why I'm -1 on merging.

The export functionality does not include the roles that come with Plone. It
appears that these are handled somewhat differently, being real, ephemeral
utilities at the zope root registry, rather that the vogue of on-the-fly
persistent utilities.

This causes the export functionality to miss out the roles that come with Plone,
making examples of the XML format difficult to come by and customisation more
confusing.

The generated GS output is:

.. source :: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <sharing/>


The design seems sane, but I'd like to see all registered utilities being
exported, not just the ones at the current component root, and we need to be
sure that local configuration can get rid of them if needs be.
