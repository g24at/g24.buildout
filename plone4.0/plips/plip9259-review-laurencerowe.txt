PLIP 9259: Group dashboards
===========================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9259

Review #1 by Laurence Rowe (laurence@lrowe.co.uk, elro on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using python 2.6.1 and Firefox 3.5.3.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9259-group-dashboards.cfg file.

- Started instance, created site.

- Added "Portlets: View dashboard" => Authenticated permission at root

- Removed "Portlets: Manage own portlets" => Member permission on plone site


Notes and observations
----------------------

- @@manage-group-portlets links to 'Edit group dashboard portlets' instead of
  'Up to Groups Overview' like the other tabs. For consistency
  @@manage-group-dashboard should get it's own tab 'Group Dashboard', and also
  link up to 'Up to Groups Overview'

- @@dashboard should not have the green tabs when a user does not have the
  "Portlets: Manage own portlets" permission and only the one tab is visible -
  see https://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/18355/plone.app.layout/branches/elro-locked-down-dashboard/plone/app/layout/dashboard/dashboard.pt

- Presumably "Portlets: View dashboard" should be given to Member rather
  than Authenticated in the Rolemap.xml for consistency.


Not directly related to this plip
---------------------------------

- The dashboard columns are not as wide as the site portlet columns (by 12px).
  This is noticable when adding a search portlet as the rendering is a little
  mucked up

- The root level admin user is not in the AuthenticatedUsers virtual group
  (which should have the title 'Authenticated Users' set by default)

- 'Enable self-registration' and 'Let users select their own passwords' from
  @@security-controlpanel should surely be on '@@usergroup-controlpanel'

- prefs_user_memberships needs a 'Show all' button on the search for groups
  control for consistency with prefs_group_members


Conclusion
----------

Good to go with some minor changes.
