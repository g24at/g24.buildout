PLIP 9327: unified interface for lists of contents
====================================================

This PLIP is ready for review 

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9327


To do
-----

- Add more tests 

- Add smarter handling of user and date lookups so that templates won't have to be contaminated by tool-lookup-logic. Perhaps we want date formatting for convenience.

- implement the missing Dublin Core methods that currently raise NotImplemented

- Write proper user-documentation on how to use this for integrators.


Further ideas
-------------

Related ideas that may be nice to incorporate into this plip.

- Actually change one of the default templates, like folder listing to use the interfaces provided here as an example

- also implement an adapter for actual content objects instead of just for catalog brains. That would make this even more generally usable.


Summary of changes
------------------

- Added a package https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.contentlisting/  with the needed functionality. 

- Minor change in plone.app.layout to make it even simpler to print icon image tags for integrators.




Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

A tutorial or how-to on plone.org should be written to explain to users how to get listings of content for different scenarios, how this is different from what has been done before and what attributes the returned listings provide (i.e what is in the interface)


Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

This plip only adds functionality and doesn't remove any existing code, nor does it change any existing scripts. Templates or views need to be updated to take advantage of this new technology. In return, all templates and views in 3-rd party pacakges using old methods of getting at lists of content will just keep working as before.
