PLIP 9285: Manage actions through-the-plone
=================================================================

This plip is in progress.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9329

Summary of changes
------------------

- Added new control panel "Manage actions" that allows the manage to add,
  remove or edit actions from the available categories.

To do
-----

- Didn't branch CMFPlone for this PLIP, so when merging a new control panel
  actions must be added to Plone default profile at controlpanel.xml:

 <configlet title="Actions" action_id="Actions" appId="Plone"
    category="Plone" condition_expr=""
    icon_expr="string:$portal_url/confirm_icon.png"
    url_expr="string:${portal_url}/@@actions-controlpanel" visible="True"
    i18n:attributes="title">
  <permission>Manage portal</permission>
 </configlet>

- More tests.

- Currently only managing actions from action provider portal_actions. It
  probaly should manage also actions from portal_types and other providers
  that may exist in some setups.

- The implementation of the add/edit forms should be improved by using
  traversal adapters to access the forms with urls like:
    portal_url/++actioncategory++site_actions/++action++sitemap/edit

- Due to time constraints I wasn't still able to implement an AJAX action
  management form. Some impproments should be made to reduce the number of
  clicks when adding/editing new actions.

- There should be a confirmation page when removing actions.

- The action add/edit forms need pre-validation.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- The Plone User Manual needs to be updated with information about the new
  actions control panel.
  http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual/

- New documentation on how to define managed categories and managed actions.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

This PLIP includes essentially presentational improvements. The changes made 
aren't expected to break existing functionality in any way.
