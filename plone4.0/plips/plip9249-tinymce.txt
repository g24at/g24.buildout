PLIP 9249: Add TinyMCE as the default visual editor
===================================================

This plip is merged.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9249


Summary of changes
------------------

- Added Products.TinyMCE as dependency to Products.CMFPlone.

- Install Products.TinyMCE automatically when a new Plone Site is added.

- Removed Products.TinyMCE from the uninstall view of Quick Installer.

- Moved remaining html filter settings from Kupu library tool to safe_html
  transform.

- Added default_editor to the Site Settings control panel.

- Set TinyMCE as the default editor for new sites.

- Added 'Use site default' to the wysiwyg_editor field in the Personal
  Preferences view.
  
- Set default editor for new users to blank (use site default).

- All the changes of the TinyMCE product itself can be found at:
  http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.TinyMCE/trunk/docs/HISTORY.txt

- Control panel is moved to the "Plone Configuration" section.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

The Plone 3 User Manual (located at: 
http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual) needs to be updated
and replace the Kupu features with the TinyMCE ones. See:
http://plone.org/products/tinymce/documentation/manual/tinymce-user-manual
for the documentation currently available for TinyMCE.

http://plone.org/products/tinymce/documentation/ also contains other user,
integrator and developer documentation.


Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

Kupu is still available in Plone 4 so all users are still able to use that.
HTML filter settings are used both in Kupu and TinyMCE so no compatibility
issues there either. Settings from the Kupu control panel are also available in
the TinyMCE control panel, these need to be migrated manually.
