PLIP 9305: Use real names instead of usernames
==============================================

This plip is merged.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9305


Further ideas
-------------

If the lookup of the fullname will turn out to be to slow, a more optimized
method needs to be used. Current speed tests seem ok, only a 2.4% speed decrease
on search result pages. 

See also the very simple performance_test https://dev.plone.org/plone/attachment/ticket/9305/performance_report.txt
