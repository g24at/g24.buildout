PLIP 9250: JQuery Tools Integration
===================================

This plip is ready for merge.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9250


Changes since review
--------------------

- Package renamed to plone.app.jquerytools

- Javascript registry resource renamed to ++resource++plone.app.jquerytools.js

- jQuery Tools updated to 1.1.0

- Creation of JS registry entry added to migration profile in plone.app.upgrade


Summary of changes
------------------

- Created plone.app.jqtools which adds jq tools as a resource and
  installs it into the js registry. It also contains licensing and
  copyright details for JQuery Tools, which is a third-party GPL/MIT
  dual-licensed plug in. All the tools *except* flash embed are included.
  
  This copy of JQ Tools is slightly customized to allow CSS-only formatting
  of overlays. I'm in communication with the JQ Tools author, who plans to
  integrate this into the next release of the overlay module.
  
  JQuery Tools documentation is available at: http://flowplayer.org/tools/
  

- Added plone.app.jqtools as dependency to Products.CMFPlone.


To Do
-----

- Before final integration, I intend to minify the patched overlay code,
  or if jqtools has been updated to the patch, substitute the new version.


Summary of work *not* done
--------------------------

  In the PLIP, I'd mentioned the possibility of including a CSS-integration
  framework for use with JQ Tools. This would have been based on work I'm
  doing in Products.pipbox. I think it makes more sense at this point to 
  keep that out of the Plone core â€” in part so that I continue development
  of pipbox without being constrained to the Plone release cycle. Maybe
  a PLIP for 4.1. ;)
  

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

  Add section to Plone Dev Manual explaining availability of JQ Tools for
  tabs, tooltips, fancy scrolling and overlays.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

  No issues
