PLIP 9329: Manage actions through-the-plone
===========================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9329

Review #3 by Rob Gietema (rob@fourdigits.nl, Rob|4D on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using python 2.6.1 and Firefox 3.5.2.


Review steps
------------

- Run buildout using the plip9329-manage-actions-ttp.cfg file.

- Run tests for plone.app.controlpanel

- Visual review of the code changes in plone.app.controlpanel

- Started instance, created site, browsed to @@actions-controlpanel


Notes and observations
----------------------

- plone.app.controlpanel finished with 0 errors and 0 failures.

- Code changes to plone.app.controlpanel all look sane.

- The default selected tab is "(Select a category)". A better option would be to
  select the first tab by default and remove the dummy option.

- After editing an action you always fall back to the default tab. Fallback to
  the current tab would be better.

- The PLIP mentions being able to reorder the actions. There is no UI for that
  yet as far as I can see.

- Through the ZMI you can select "Link Target" for each action which isn't
  available in the TTP version. This option also seems to be new to 4 as I don't
  see this in 3.3.

- The edit / delete links at the end of the each row are not very "Plonish". I'd
  prefer checkboxes in front of each row and one delete button next to "Add new
  action".

- The items in the list are clickable and lead to the url expression of the
  item. Since this is a control panel I would expect the link to go to the
  edit screen. An option would be to add a "preview" link.

- The visible column show "True" or "False". It would be better to use "Yes" and
  "No" here since it's more an enduser screen.

- The description could be used as title attribute for the action.

- I know it has been approved by the FWT that there will be a pulldown menu
  to select the tabs but since there are only 4 options I think it is more
  userfriendly to show normal tabs so the user can see right away what options
  are available.

- The edit screen could use some more help text for each field. If you know what
  the fields do it's logical but for a new user some explaination will help a
  lot.


Conclusion
----------

Apart from the mentioned ui improvements the implementation looks good. I think
this is a nice feature to have and would like to see this in Plone 4.
