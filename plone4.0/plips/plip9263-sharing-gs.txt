===============================================================

This plip is in progress.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9263


To do
-----

- more testing

Summary of changes
------------------

- Adds exportimport module and exportimport.zcml to plone.app.workflow.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

Documentation should describe this feature.  Something like this:

To add new roles to the "Sharing" tab (next to "Can add", "Can edit", etc.),
you can use a GenericSetup file called `sharing.xml` in your profile. It
should look like this::

    <sharing xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n" i18n:domain="plone">
        <role
            id="CopyEditor"
            title="Can edit copy"
            permission="Manage portal"
            i18n:attributes="title"
            />
    </sharing>

You probably also need to install the role ("CopyEditor" in this example).
Use `rolemap.xml` for this as usual::

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rolemap>
        <roles>
            <role name="CopyEditor" />
        </roles>
        <permissions />
    </rolemap>

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

This is a new feature. There should be no compatibility issues.

This change is ported from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.sharingroles.
Compatibility with sites using this product is intended, but has not been
extensively tested yet.

The two handlers should co-exist peacefully.
