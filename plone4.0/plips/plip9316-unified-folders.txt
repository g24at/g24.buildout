PLIP 9316: Unify folder implementations
=======================================

This PLIP is ready for review.

Trac ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9316


Summary of changes
------------------

- Added `plone.app.folder` as a dependency to `Plone`.

- Update the FTI for "Folder" content to use the new implementation.

- Replaced `BaseBTreeFolder` with new implementation in `Products.Archetypes`.

- Replaced `ATFolder` with new implementation in `Products.ATContentTypes`.


To do
-----

- Fix remaining tests failures in various packages.

- Add upgrade step for folder migration in `plone.app.upgrade`.

- Ensure backward-compatibility by setting up a buildbot to test against
  Plone 3.x and Plone 4.0.

- Fix benchmark tests.

- Investigate pickle and transaction sizes in comparison with the existing
  folder implementation.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

As the new folderish classes/types should be mostly transparent to users and
integrators, there is no real need for any updates.  However, documentation
for developers should probably describe the changes and especially the new
locations of the base classes nevertheless.


Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

The packages aim to provide fully backward-compatible versions of the existing
folder implementations.  A buildbot will be provided to ensure this for all
minor versions in the 3.x series as well as for Plone 4.0.
